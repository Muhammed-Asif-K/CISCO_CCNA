 Passive Interface with EIGRP â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This project demonstrates the configuration of an **EIGRP-enabled network** in Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on **passive interfaces** to control routing updates, along with IP addressing, loopback configuration, and path verification.



 Network Setup Steps

1. Assign IP Addresses to PCs

   * Configured each PC with a static IP, subnet mask, and default gateway based on its connected network.

2. Configure Router Interfaces

   * Assigned IP addresses to all router interfaces connected to PCs and other routers.
   * Enabled interfaces with `no shutdown`.

3. EIGRP Routing Configuration

   * Enabled EIGRP (AS 100) on all routers.
   * Advertised directly connected networks.
   * Used `no auto-summary` to prevent classful routing.

4. Loopback Configuration on Router 3

   * Created a loopback interface (e.g., Loopback0) with an IP address to simulate an additional network.
   * Advertised this loopback in EIGRP for testing purposes.

5. Testing & Best Path Verification

   * Used the `ping` command from different routers to verify connectivity across the network.
   * Checked the **routing tables (`show ip route`)** to see the selected best path.

6. Passive Interface Configuration

   * Applied the `passive-interface` command on interfaces connected to PCs to stop sending EIGRP updates on those links while still advertising the network.
   * Ensured routing updates only occur between routers, reducing unnecessary traffic.

7. Packet Flow Observation

   * Used Packet Tracer Simulation Mode to observe the exact path taken by packets after applying passive interface configuration.
   * Compared the path before and after enabling passive interfaces.



Final Outcome

* All PCs and loopback networks are reachable through EIGRP routing.
* Passive interfaces prevent unnecessary routing updates to end devices.
* Packet flow follows the most optimal path as determined by EIGRP metrics.
