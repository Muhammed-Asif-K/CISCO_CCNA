EIGRP Network Topology Implementation

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) across a multi-router topology. The goal was to establish full reachability, configure router IDs, apply summarization, and meet special conditions as per the given requirements.

Topology

The topology consists of multiple routers (R1â€“R8) interconnected via switches, with loopback interfaces used to simulate end networks.

ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks Performed

1. EIGRP Neighbor Relationships

   * Configured EIGRP on all routers.
   * Verified that Router3 (R3) and Router6 (R6) have 7 neighbors each in their neighbor tables.

2. Loopback Reachability

   * Advertised all loopback interfaces into the EIGRP process.
   * Ensured complete reachability by pinging every loopback from all routers.

3. Router ID Configuration

   * Assigned the lowest loopback IP address on each router as the Router ID.

4. Route Summarization

   * Configured summarization on Router6 (R6) for the network range:

     
     150.10.0.0/16
    
   * This reduced the size of routing tables and optimized EIGRP updates.

5. Passive Interface

   * Configured Router8 (R8) so that it does not participate in the EIGRP process, while still being reachable.

Verification

* Used `show ip eigrp neighbors` to confirm adjacencies.
* Used `show ip route` to validate summarization at R6.
* Verified router IDs using `show ip protocols`.
* Successfully pinged all loopback networks across the topology.
* Confirmed R8 did not form adjacencies.



Conclusion

This lab successfully demonstrated:

* EIGRP configuration and neighbor formation.
* Loopback advertisement and reachability.
* Proper router ID assignment.
* Route summarization at the edge router.
* Exclusion of a router from the EIGRP process.

The network is fully functional and optimized according to the given requirements.
